Starting a blog is always an interesting challengeâ€”what should the first post be about? 

As a design engineer, I find myself constantly experimenting with tools, ideas, and workflows. This space will be where I document my insights, failures, and discoveries.

Design and engineering are often seen as separate disciplines, but they thrive when combined. My goal is to explore how to bridge the gap, optimize workflows, and push the boundaries of digital product creation.

Expect deep dives into UI performance, design tokens, AI-assisted workflows, and the intersection of engineering and design thinking.
