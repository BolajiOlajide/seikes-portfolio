Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing how we work, especially in design and development. Here's how I've integrated AI tools into my daily workflow.

## Code Generation

AI-powered code completion and generation tools have dramatically increased my productivity. They help with:

- Boilerplate code generation
- Bug fixes and optimization suggestions
- Documentation writing

## Design Assistance

AI tools are becoming invaluable for design work:

- Color palette generation
- Layout suggestions
- Content generation for prototypes

## The Human Touch

While AI is powerful, the human element remains crucial. AI enhances our capabilities but doesn't replace creative thinking and problem-solving skills.
