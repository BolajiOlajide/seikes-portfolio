User interface performance is critical for user experience. Even the most beautiful design falls short if it doesn't perform well.

## Key Metrics

- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: When users see the first piece of content
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: When the main content loads
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: How much the layout shifts during loading

## Optimization Strategies

### Images
- Use modern formats like WebP
- Implement lazy loading
- Optimize image sizes

### JavaScript
- Code splitting
- Tree shaking
- Minimize bundle sizes

### CSS
- Critical CSS inlining
- Remove unused styles
- Use CSS containment

## Measuring Performance

Regular performance audits using tools like Lighthouse help identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
