Design tokens are the building blocks of modern design systems. They're named design decisions that store visual properties like colors, typography, spacing, and more.

## What are Design Tokens?

Design tokens are platform-agnostic variables that represent the smallest atoms of your design system. They help maintain consistency across different platforms and technologies.

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Ensure visual consistency across all touchpoints
- **Maintainability**: Update once, reflect everywhere
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale design decisions across teams
- **Platform Agnostic**: Work across web, mobile, and other platforms

## Getting Started

Start with the basics: colors, typography, and spacing. These form the foundation of your design system.
