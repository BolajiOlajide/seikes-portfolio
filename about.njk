    <h1 style="font-size: 36px; font-weight: 700; margin-bottom: 32px;">About</h1>
    
    <div style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.7; color: #444;">
        <p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
            My journey started in Customer Success (as a customer success rep), Account Management, Product Ops, and Dispute Operations, where I learned that great experiences aren't just built on good tools but on clarity, structure, and people who care.
        </p>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
            I've led high-performing teams, designed processes from scratch, and shaped product experiences that made life easier for internal teams, businesses and their customers.
        </p>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
            In 2023, I co-founded a company called Mira (acquired by Chowdeck), where I served as COO. I was responsible for People, Finance, and Customer Operations, and my mission was simple: build the backbone of the business. That meant setting up the right structure, finding the right tools, and supporting the right people.

        <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #eee; padding-left: 24px; margin: 32px 0; font-style: italic; color: #666;">
            <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">At the core of everything I do is this belief:</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 600; color: #1a1a1a;">Customer Success is about creating meaningful human experiences.</p>
            <p>Because at the end of the day, every interaction; even the operational ones should feel simple, fast, and valuable for the people behind the business.</p>
