        <p>{{ site.bio }} I've led high-performing teams, designed processes from scratch, and shaped product experiences that made life easier for internal teams, businesses and their customers.</p>
        
        <p>In 2023, I co-founded a company called Mira (acquired by Chowdeck), where I served as COO. I was responsible for People, Finance, and Customer Operations, and my mission was simple: build the backbone of the business. That meant setting up the right structure, finding the right tools, and supporting the right people.</p>
        
        <p>At the core of everything I do is this belief:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Customer Success is about creating meaningful human experiences.</strong><br>Because at the end of the day, every interaction; even the operational ones should feel simple, fast, and valuable for the people behind the business.</p>
